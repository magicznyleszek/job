Hi,

I'm a unicorn. I don't give into stress easily, or believe in conflicts. I love teamwork.

Currently I work at GOG (http://www.gog.com) in a team of 10 developers. My main responsibility is creating a frontend of GOG Galaxy desktop application. I also develop some webapps and take part in recruiting new developers and introducing them to the project.

I plan to start a family soon, so I am looking for a remote opportunity to be able to move outside of the big city.

Cheers,
Leszek
