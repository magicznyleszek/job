Hi,

I'm a unicorn. I don't give into stress easily, or believe in conflicts. I love teamwork.

Currently I work at KoBoToolbox ([kobotoolbox.org](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/)) in a team of 5 developers. My main responsibility is creating a frontend for open source data collection tool. I'm happy with the company, but am still open on finding something more permanent.

My family grew few months ago, so I am looking for a remote opportunity to be able to spend as much time as possible during those precious first years.

Cheers,
Leszek
