I am a creator, I always loved building something new: be it through writing, drawing or coding. As for frontend development, I love that my work can be experienced live in the browser and that I can publish anything in just a few minutes.

The three values closest to my heart are: order, meaning and simplicity. I fear for the future of humanity, so I don't want to throw more senseless evil out there - I would love to take part in a meaningful, nature- and future-friendly projects. I try to maintain good work/life balance, so I avoid toxic environments.

## Skills

I have strong frontend development skills with some backend experience. I can do identity design, UI design and illustration - I mainly use Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I am no stranger to Scrum, Kanban, recruitment, introducing new people into projects and copywriting. I’m familiar with all the OSs, but my favourite setup is MacOS with Atom.

Technologies I would love to work with: __TypeScript__ or __ES6__, __Angular__, __React__, __NPM__, __cssnext__ and __Jekyll__. I would also like to have __TDD__, __code reviews__, __pair programming__ and good planning with estimations.

Some technologies I worked with: HTML (Twig), CSS (Compass, Sass, cssnext, BEM, MADCSS), JavaScript (TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ES6 [Babel], Angular, React, Alt, Backbone, Phaser, Lodash, jQuery, TweenMax), TDD (Karma, Jasmine, PhantomJS, Sinopia), Grunt, NPM, Git, CEF, Jekyll, MySQL, PHP (Symfony2), Jira, Asana.
