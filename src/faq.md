# FAQ

Some answers for some soft questions.

### What is your story as a developer?

1. I was building websites since I remember. Mostly personal with CSS and HTML/PHP.
2. During my second college I started drawing and got into design.
3. I met my now-wife over internets, moved to Warsaw and found a job in a half-startup as a designer.
4. After I did most of the planned tasks, I turned into full-stack web-developer as there was a great need for it and devs were behind with work.
5. I learned a lot of new things and my next job was as a front-end developer in a media agency.
6. There I learned Angular and improved my skills further.
7. Then I got a job at GOG as a one-man team -- I've built GOG Galaxy frontend part.
8. I learned a lot of dev-related stuff (again), but also started taking part in recruitment and have built a team of 4 devs (myself included).
9. Now I want to built my life in some nice place.

### Why developer? What do you like in developer job?

I am a creator, I always loved creating new things: be it through writing, drawing, designing or coding. And as frontend/webdevelopment goes - there is this great feature of stuff being run automagically in the browser. You can create and share in just a few minutes.

### What do you dislike in developer job?

I don't like when technology needs to have many hacks applied, when the documentation and theoretical architecture is not yet reflected in the real environment.

### What are your driving factors?

Three things I value the most: order, meaning and simplicity. I think I work as a developer because of how easily the ideas can be brought into existence and how boundless the possibilities are. I also feel like writing small working parts of code is like writing beautiful poetry -- there is a place for creativity and purpose.

### What makes you passionate about Technology?

I am a creator, I always loved creating something new: be it through writing, drawing, coding or arranging stuff beautifuly in a fridge. Technology for me is about bringing ideas into existence and turning an impossibly long task into a one button action! I also feel like writing code is like writing Haiku -- it has a purpose, positively limiting set of rules, and at the same time boundless possibilities.

As for frontend/webdevelopment, I love that my code can be experienced in the browser just a seconds after I saved the file, and how you can tweak it live. You can create and share in just a few minutes, and it can be anything you want. [Anything](http://qwerty.smutnyleszek.com/b/).

### What are yout weaknesses?

1. Over-polishing tasks -- but I try to fight it with code design, more planning and prioretizing
2. Introvertic -- I am a better listener/observer than talker

### What are yout strengths?

1. I'm a unicorn. I know both sides: designer's and developer's perspective
2. Cool-headed -- I don't give into stress easily, or believe in conflicts
4. Helpful -- I like being a part of a team and helping people with their tasks or with introduction to new projects

### What is your greatest accomplishment?

1. Moved to an unknown city and found my first job in 2 weeks
2. Single-handedly built a frontend part of an app used by millions users worldwide

### What software engineering accomplishment are you most proud of?

I've single-handedly built a frontend for [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy), a desktop app used by millions users worldwide. Being a lone wolf had some serious downsides of course -- without code reviews and another frontend people to throw ideas at, it was really hard to spot all the bad decisions. But then the team grew, and I managed to introduce few frontend devs into the project. Together we've brought the app to the awesome shape that it is now.

### What is your biggest failure?

Broke a production website, because of badly configured GIT and me not knowing Drupal enough. Now I ask questions when I don't know, read documentations and try to understand deeply even the small things.

### What motivate you to change your life?

Life opportunities, personal happiness.

### What are you looking for?

I would like to work in a company that loves teamwork, planning and have it's own product(s). I value tolerance and sense of humor in people the most. As I fear for the future of humanity, I don't want to throw more senseless evil out there. I would love to take part in a meaningful, nature- and future-friendly projects.

### What would be the ideal project?

Project: it could be something that would help our planet not die quickly or something that would make deep-space colonization possible.

There would be a few different teams - mine with about 6 developers, 2 designers, 2 QAs and Scrum/Jira magician. There needs to be a global architect and styles pattern library. We have code reviews, pair programming and lot's of unit testing (75% coverage as minimum). We also plan a lot to know stuff beforehand.

As for frontend: small components. Tech stack: JavaScript (TypeScript) - probably React/Angular with Alt or custom-built solution, pregenerated HTML templates - Jekyll, or Node-based Twig and raw CSS - latest features via cssnext. BEM or MADCSS.

### What is important for you in every day work?

1. Having a team: code reviews, pair programming, testing ideas
2. Having a clear plan: future steps planning, estimations, milestones, Kanban board
3. Good work/life balance

### What do you expect from your future lead?

null

### What do you expect from new work place?

null

### With what kind of people do you like to work with?

null

### How do you handle if someone disagree with you in your team?

I will ask her/him if she/he could explain to me why. I would try to understand the arguments. Will agree if it makes sense, or try to explain my side in comparison.

### What is your current team structure?

There are 4 frontend developers, 6 C++ developers (one being Team Leader) and one QA tester.

### What was the last piece of Technology that impressed you? What have you learnt recently?

I think that could be [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). It makes it easy for a frontend developer to build a desktop application with ease. I like that it allows you basically to use any tech stack you want: so I can build HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and run Angular or React in there.

### What was the last piece of Technology you played with outside of Work?

As a learning exercise I've developed [Hues](https://github.com/smutnyleszek/hues), a React + Alt webapp written in ES6 (Babel) that does color conversion. It was pretty interested experience. Doing templates in JS files was a refreshing idea, and I love having a whole state in single place. I also liked some of ES6 features: consts, fat arrows and Maps are my favs.

### How do you learn new stuff?

Mostly I try to develop personal projects to understand given new technology.

### Which Technical bloggers do you respect and why?

The ones that came to my mind:

- [Trent Walton](http://trentwalton.com/) for his now-inactive blog, mainly for the articles on code architecture
- [Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/) not for something particular, but every now and then I stumble upon some great article, and at the end it turns out that he wrote it :-D
- Glenn Maddern for [droppping classes in favour of attributes](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/introducing-am-css)
- Heydon Pickering for his bold, avant-garde [Lobotomized Owl](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls) idea
- [Floris Dekker](http://florisdekker.com/) for awesome Little Big Details

### What is your relevant online presence?

My relevant online presence:

- [github.com/smutnyleszek](https://github.com/smutnyleszek) -- I have multiple projects that I'm proud of there
- [leszekpietrzak.com](http://leszekpietrzak.com/) -- it is mainly design/illustration, but I feel that my designer skills are very useful when doing frontend

I do have [SO account](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2311247/leszek) -- I have answered only two questions, but it says that I've impacted ~259 people, so I think that is something ;-)

### On a scale of 1 (Hello, World) to 10 (Timothy J Fontaine) how would you rate your JavaScript skills?

I think 7 is my number. I don't have all the String.prototype methods memorized, but I am able to understand the code that I see, and I am pretty confident that I can build anything I want.

### Are there any other technologies you are skilled in you would like to brag about? Please don't be modest.

I can draw illustrations, portraits, abstract art.

As my background is in Graphic Design and I still do it professionally, I can say that I am pretty skilled in using Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign for producing DTP stuff.

I can also draw complex architectural schematics in AutoCAD -- and I would like to point out how awesomely precise it is with vector illustration in comparison to Adobe products.

I did wrote some games using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework and I recall it was pretty interesting.

I also used [TweenMax](https://greensock.com/tweenmax) for some complex animate-as-you-scroll websites.

The first programming language that I've learned was PHP (quickly followed by MySQL), and I did write some while working with Drupal and WordPress. I wouldn't say I can do a backend dev tasks, but at least I can understand and tweak existing code.

I know Windows, MacOS and some Linux distributions (my favourite was [CrunchBang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrunchBang_Linux), developed in UK!).

I can also produce movies (i.e. use Adobe After Effects) if necessary. I can even do a traditional animation.

### Spaces or tabs, why?

I don't remember why, but I started with using 4 spaces and it just stuck. Some time ago I did some research on "why my decision is The Right Decision", and read somewhere that TAB character can cause a file reading problem in some rare environments. But I guess what I don't like in tabs is that they are not the same width as everything else (in monospaces font of course). Recently, after I started keeping my files at 80-chars, I am thinking about trying 2 spaces -- but this would require me to do a global switch, as I do love being consistent. I don't even consider 3 spaces, as odd numbers are yuck.
