Hi,

I'll try to be quick and to the point.

Currently I work at [GOG](http://www.gog.com) in a team of 10 developers. My main responsibility is creating a frontend of GOG Galaxy desktop application. I also develop some webapps and take part in recruiting new developers and introducing them to the project. But my favourite thing is the teamwork: I feel that sharing knowledge, code reviews and pair programming are just priceless.

I plan to move to London soon and your company sounds like a really cool place to work at.

Cheers,
Leszek
